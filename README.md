# Introductory Sentiment Analysis (Kaggle Dataset)
I have demonstrated a vary basic technique for performing sentiment analysis using Naive-Bayes classifier in python. Naive-Bayes is a very simple yet effective tehnique, specially useful if the amount of dataset is small. The code can be found in this [IPython-Notebook](https://github.com/avneet14027/Sentiment-Analysis-Kaggle/blob/master/Introductory%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)
